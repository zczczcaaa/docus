## `pnpm` issues

### Approve build scripts

If you encounter build or dev errors when using `pnpm`, especially related to `better-sqlite3` dependency, you might need to approve certain packages for building.

Run the following command to approve packages for building:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm approve-builds
```

When prompted, select `better-sqlite3` and `sharp` from the list of packages to approve it for building.

### Enable shameful hoisting (compatibility mode)

If you see errors such as `Can't resolve 'tailwindcss'` or `Can't resolve '@nuxt/ui'` you don't necessary need to import them, you can just apply a flat `node_modules` layout (like npm or yarn).

You can enable compatibility mode by creating a `.npmrc` file with:

```bash [.npmrc]
shamefully-hoist=true
```
