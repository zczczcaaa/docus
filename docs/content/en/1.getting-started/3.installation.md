## `create-docus` CLI

::steps
### Create your docs directory

Use the `create-docus` CLI to create a new Docus project:

```bash [Terminal]
npx create-docus my-docs
```

You can choose between two templates:

- `default`: Basic Docus setup for single-language documentation
- `i18n`: Includes internationalization support for multi-language documentation

```bash [Terminal]
# Create with i18n template
npx create-docus my-docs -t i18n
```

We recommend using the `npm` package manager.

### Start your docs server in development

Move to your docs directory and start your docs server in development mode:

```bash [Terminal]
cd my-docs
npm run dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at <http://localhost:3000>

### Write your documentation

Head over the [Edition](/en/concepts/edition) section to learn how to write your documentation.

## AI Assistant Skill

Get started quickly with Docus by adding specialized knowledge to your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude, etc.):

```bash [Terminal]
npx skills add nuxt-content/docus
```

This skill helps you create documentation faster by providing your AI assistant with:
- 📝 Best practices for writing documentation with Docus
- 🎨 MDC component usage and ready-to-use templates
- 📚 Writing guidelines and content structure patterns
- 🔧 Configuration and customization tips

Once installed, your AI assistant can help you scaffold new documentation projects, generate pages with proper structure, and write content following Docus best practices.

## Layer Integration

Docus v4 uses a **Nuxt layer-based approach**, you can extend the Docus layer directly in your `nuxt.config.ts` with `extends: ['docus']`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['docus']
})
```
