The **Nuxt Studio** module is a browser-based interface for editing your Nuxt Content website directly in production. Access it by GitHub authentication on your deployed site, and start managing content without any local development tools.

::tip{to="https://content.nuxt.com/docs/studio/setup"}
Browse Nuxt Content documentation to learn how ton install the module.

## Studio Editor vs. Local Development

The **studio editor** allows you to manage content entirely from your browser on your production website. There's no need for local development tools, Git commands, or terminal access. It's ideal for content teams who want to edit and preview changes in a familiar environment.

**Local development**, on the other hand, is designed for developers who prefer working in their own IDE with full control over the codebase.

::note
Both approaches integrate with GitHub, so you can switch between them. Changes made in Studio are committed to your repository.

## Studio Editor :badge[Alpha Release]

![visual-editor-studio.png](/documentation/visual-editor-studio.png)

The alpha release features **Monaco editor**, the same powerful code editor that powers VS Code.

It focuses on **core infrastructure and stability** without risking any bugs introduced by the Visual editor. We're using Monaco editor to ensure all file operations and GitHub workflows are rock-solid before introducing visual editing.

#### 📦 What's included in Alpha

**✓ Monaco Code Editor**
Professional editing experience with syntax highlighting for Markdown, YAML, and JSON, including full MDC syntax support and split-screen diff viewer for conflicts.

**✓ File Operations**
Complete CRUD operations for your `content/` directory—create, edit, delete, rename, and move files with built-in draft management.

**✓ Media Management**
Centralized library for assets in your `public/` directory with upload, organize, preview, and integrate capabilities.

**✓ Git Integration**
Direct commits to GitHub via OAuth with conflict detection, author attribution, and custom commit messages.

**✓ Real-time Preview**
Live preview of draft changes on your production website with instant updates and side-by-side editing.

### 🗺️ What's coming next

#### Beta Release `Q4 2025`

Inspired from what we've built on [nuxt.studio](https://nuxt.studio), the beta phase will introduce the open-source visual editor, making Studio accessible to non-technical users:

- **Form-based Editing** — Schema-based forms for Markdown frontmatter, YAML, and JSON files
- **Vue Component Edition** — Visual interface for editing component props and slots
- **Google OAuth** — Alternative authentication for non-GitHub users

#### Stable Release `End of Year 2025`

Production-ready features, performance optimizations, and enhanced stability.
