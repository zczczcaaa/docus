Docus is built on top of Nuxt 4 which offers a flexible component layer system that allows you to override some part of the UI by redefining specific components in your own app. This makes it easy to fully customize the visual appearance and behavior of your documentation without touching the core theme.

To override a component, simply create a Vue file with the same name in the `components/` directory. Docus will automatically use your version instead of the default one.

## App Header

You can customize different parts of the header by overriding the following components:

### `AppHeaderLogo`

For simple adjustments like changing the logo size, you can use the `logo.class` option in `app.config.ts` without overriding the component (e.g. `class: 'h-8'`).

To fully replace the default logo in the header, create the `components/AppHeaderLogo.vue` file. Your component will replace the default one provided by Docus theme. You can use the `useLogoAssets()` composable to keep the right-click context menu with copy and download actions.

### `AppHeaderCTA`

To customize the call-to-action area in the header (for example, adding a “Get Started” button or external link), override the `components/AppHeaderCTA.vue` component.

### `AppHeaderCenter`

To customize the center area in the header, override the `components/AppHeaderCenter.vue` component. Your component will replace the search bar provided by Docus theme.

### `AppHeaderBody`

By default, when you open the menu on mobile view, Docus is displaying your `content/` folder tree as a menu with the [ContentNavigation](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/content-navigation) component. You can override this menu with the `components/AppHeaderBody.vue` component and fill the menu body (under the header) in mobile.

If you want to customize the header globally, maybe you should consider using your own layout.

## App Footer

You can customize different parts of the footer by overriding the following components:

### `AppFooterLeft`

To replace the left side of the header, create the `components/AppFooterLeft.vue` file. Your component will replace the default one provided by Docus theme.

## Docs

You can also customize header and both asides of the documentation pages.

### `DocsPageHeaderLinks`

In the header right side of your documentation page, Docus default behaviour is displaying a dropdown with quick actions related to the current page’s Markdown source. It allows the reader of the documentation to:

- **Copy a direct link** to the raw `.md` file to the clipboard.
- **View the Markdown source** in a new browser tab.
- **Open the page’s content in ChatGPT or Claude**, pre-filled with a prompt to analyze the Markdown file.

These actions are especially useful for contributors, readers, or AI-assisted workflows but you can create your own `components/DocsPageHeaderLinks.vue` component to override it.

## Custom Icons

Docus uses [Nuxt Icon](https://github.com/nuxt/icon) with the [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) provider, giving you access to thousands of icons out of the box (e.g. `i-lucide-arrow-right`, `i-simple-icons-github`).

To add your own icons, place SVG files in the `assets/icons/` directory of your app. They are automatically registered under the `custom` prefix and available everywhere in your project.

```
assets/
  icons/
    my-logo.svg
```

You can then use them with the `i-custom:` prefix:

```md [content/getting-started.md]
---
navigation:
  icon: i-custom:my-logo
---
```

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  toc: {
    bottom: {
      links: [{
        icon: 'i-custom:my-logo',
        label: 'Preview',
        to: '/preview'
      }]
    }
  }
})
```

```vue [components/MyComponent.vue]
<template>
  <UIcon name="i-custom:my-logo" />
</template>
```

::prose-tip{to="https://iconify.design/docs/icons/icon-set-basics.html"}
SVG files should use `currentColor` for fills and strokes so the icon adapts to text color.
