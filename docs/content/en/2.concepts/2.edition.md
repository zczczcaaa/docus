  description: Learn how to write your documentation with Docus and Nuxt Content.
  title: Edition
---

Docus lets you write all your content in **Markdown** but also provide the ability to integrate **components** with the [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax) provided by **Nuxt Content**.

::prose-tip{to="/en/essentials/components"}

## Landing page

The landing page is the first page your visitors see at the root `/` of your site. By default, Docus uses the `content/index.md` file to render this page.

### `Markdown` (default)

By default, the landing page corresponds to the `content/index.md` file.

Docus automatically:

- Creates a `landing` content collection for the `content/index.md` file
- Registers the `/` route to render your Markdown landing page

The `MDC` syntax gives you the ability to use Vue components, including slots and props in your `.md` files. You can use any [Nuxt UI component](https://ui.nuxt.com/docs/components) in your Markdown to build your landing page.

### `Vue` (custom)

Since Docus is a layer, it allows you to fully customize your landing page by creating a Vue page at `app/pages/index.vue`. This gives you full control with Vue components, custom layouts, and advanced interactions.

In this case, Docus:

- Do not create `landing` collection
- Use native Nuxt router and consider `index.vue` as your home page

::prose-note
This automatic detection works for both single-language and multi-language (i18n) setups.
::

### Components

MDC provides a dedicated syntax to easily use Vue components in your content:

```mdc [content/index.md]
:::u-page-feature
:::
```

### Slots

Slots can receive text content or other components.

- **Default slot** is rendered directly inside the component or with `#default`.
- **Named slots** are defined using the `#` symbol followed by the slot name.

```mdc [index.md]
:::u-page-feature
  #title
  Nuxt 4
  
  #description
  Powered by Nuxt 4 for optimal performances and SEO.
:::
```

### Props

Props are passed using inline syntax or YAML frontmatter within the component block:

::prose-tabs
  :::prose-tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-braces" label="Inline"}
  ```mdc [index.md]
  :::u-page-feature{icon="i-simple-icons-nuxt" to="https://nuxt.com"}
    #title
    Nuxt 4
    
    #description
    Powered by Nuxt 4 for optimal performances and SEO.
  :::
  ```
  :::

  :::prose-tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-code" label="YAML"}
  ```mdc [index.md]
  :::u-page-feature
    ---
    icon: i-simple-icons-nuxt
    to: https://nuxt.com
    ---
    #title
    Nuxt 4
    
    #description
    Powered by Nuxt 4 for optimal performances and SEO.
  :::
  ```

## Documentation pages

::prose-tip
There is a one to one relationship between content files and pages on your site. Each Markdown page in the `content/` folder maps directly to a page route.
::

### Without docs folder

To get started, simply edit or add a `.md` files in the `content/` directory to have your pages updated. Docus will handle routing, navigation, and full-text search automatically.

```bash
content/
├── index.md              # Landing page → /
├── getting-started.md    # Documentation → /getting-started
└── guide/
    └── introduction.md   # Documentation → /guide/introduction
```

### With docs folder

You can optionally organize your documentation files within a `docs/` subfolder. When Docus detects a `docs/` folder in your `content/` directory, it automatically prefixes all documentation URLs with `/docs`.

```bash
content/
├── index.md                  # Landing page → /
└── docs/
    ├── getting-started.md    # Documentation → /docs/getting-started
    └── guide/
        └── introduction.md   # Documentation → /docs/guide/introduction
```

::prose-tip
This is particularly useful when you want to use Docus as embedded documentation alongside other custom pages. You can create additional pages like a blog, contact page, pricing page, or any other custom content at the root level, while keeping your documentation organized under `/docs`.
::

### Mixed content

Since Docus is a Nuxt layer, you can combine Markdown files with custom Vue pages:

```bash
├── app/
│   └── pages/
│       ├── pricing.vue       # Custom pricing page → /pricing
│       └── contact.vue       # Custom contact page → /contact
└── content/
    ├── index.md              # Landing page → /
    └── blog.md               # Blog page → /blog
    └── docs/                 # Documentation → /docs/*
        ├── getting-started.md
        └── api/
            └── reference.md
```

This structure gives you the flexibility to build a complete website with Docus. Use Markdown for documentation and Vue pages for custom functionality like blogs, dashboards, or any interactive pages.

### Frontmatter

Every file of the `content/` folder starts with the `---` syntax on top of the page. It corresponds to the frontmatter of your file which is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to pages.

::prose-tabs
  :::prose-tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-code" label="Code"}
  ```md [content/getting-started/edition.md]
  ---
  title: 'Edition'
  description: 'Learn how to write your documentation.'
  ---

  <!-- Content of the page in pure Markdown -->
  ```
  :::

  :::prose-tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-eye" label="Preview"}
  ![Frontmatter title and description](/documentation/frontmatter-preview-title-description.png)
  :::
::

### Parameters

Pages in the `/content` directory are defined as [page](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/collections/types#page-type) type in Nuxt Content. They all follow the same structure with existing frontmatter keys:
